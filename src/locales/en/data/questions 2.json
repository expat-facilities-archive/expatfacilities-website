    "question": "Do I need to be vaccinated to travel ?",
    "answer": "Before going on a trip, it is important to find out what precautions to take and what vaccinations are needed in the host country. It is preferable to have all the basic vaccinations up to date, regardless of your destination. We strongly recommend that you consult your general practitioner before leaving, as he or she will be able to advise you on the best way to prepare for your trip. Some countries may require proof of vaccination to enter the country (vaccination passport, health booklet, etc)"
