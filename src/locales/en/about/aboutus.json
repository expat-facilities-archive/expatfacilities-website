  "description": {
    "first":"Our story begins in 2020, following our second year of university exchange. In the midst of discussing our eye-opening experiences during a road trip in South Asia, we realised how complicated the administrative procedures are as expats: a source of stress, a waste of money, a waste of time... A precious time, which could have been spent on other activities.",
    "second":"This is why we had the innovative idea, shared by us, 3 students: to facilitate the expatriation of young students deciding to live a professional experience abroad, and to allow them to make the most of their trip without hassle!",
    "third":"We then took the necessary steps, founded a team, found partners and from there was born: Expat Facilities!"
